## 🔍 What Does EpicOneMace Do?

EpicOneMace is a straightforward Minecraft plugin that ensures only one mace can exist on your server at any time:

- 🛡️ **One Mace Rule**: Only one mace can exist on the entire server
- 👑 **Ownership System**: The first player to craft or pick up a mace becomes its rightful owner
- 🚫 **Automatic Prevention**: Other players cannot craft or pick up maces while one exists
- 🔄 **Admin Controls**: Server operators can reset mace status with simple commands
- 🔍 **Status Checking**: Anyone can check who currently owns the mace

The plugin works silently in the background with zero configuration needed. It's lightweight, efficient, and does exactly what it promises - nothing more, nothing less.

## 🎮 Commands

- `/checkmace` - See who currently holds the mace (available to all players)
- `/resetmace` - Reset the mace status to allow a new one to be crafted (op only)

## ⚠️ Why I Made This Plugin

I created EpicOneMace after discovering that several existing one-mace plugins contained suspicious code, with one even including a backdoor that compromised servers. My server [Celestial Universe](https://discord.gg/yvSakgCmhP) and several friends' servers (including Haunted SMP) were affected by these malicious plugins.

Specifically, a plugin on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/onemace) created by a user named "ftpman" (Discord: "tim cheese") contained code that gave unauthorized access to servers. If you've installed this plugin, I strongly recommend removing it immediately and checking your server for any suspicious activity.

EpicOneMace is my contribution to the Minecraft community - a clean, safe alternative that does exactly what it's supposed to do without compromising your server's security.
